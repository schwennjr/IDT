## **Professional Bio**

Hello! My name is Craig Schwenn. 

I started my career in 2004 as a web developer with a small company named [Web4Minds.com](http://web4minds.com/) back in 2004. In 2006, I moved to [Allstate Benefits](https://www.allstate.com/allstate-benefits/main.aspx), which is a subsidiary of [Allstate Ins](https://www.allstate.com/). Throughout my career there, I have filled many different roles, from building front-end websites to back-end data processing applications. A few years ago, I transitioned into a new position, Senior Cloud Engineer. Now, I build Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that automate the Software Delivery Life Cycle (SDLC). 

## **Purpose**

Over the years, I've had to mentor and train multiple employees to ensure they adhere to company standards and learn the systems they are working on as fast as possible. While the mentees enjoyed my training style, I often felt that it could be more structured. Also, as my responsibilities and workload have increased, I have less time to repeat the training for each new employee. By taking this Micro-Masters program, I hope to gain the skills needed to develop informative and concise training modules for new and existing employees to learn new technologies and systems on their own time. 

Upon completing each course, I will have completed a new section within this portfolio. The purpose of the portfolio is to document my journey as I discover and learn about different learning theories and implement these theories within the capstone project. The capstone project will require me to develop an online learning module using all the information I have learned throughout the program. When completed, this portfolio will act as a template I can reuse when developing future learning modules.
