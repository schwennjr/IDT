# IDT200x: Instructional Design Models

## About this course

In today’s interconnected world, online education has exploded with engaging learning experiences infused with interactive digital tools, digital media, and collaborative projects designed to engage dispersed learners. These highly engaging and effective courses are not created by chance - they are created by instructional designers using a careful and systematic design process.

In this education and teacher training course, part of the Instructional Design and Technology MicroMasters Program we will look at the history and evolution of online learning. You will explore traditional instructional design models and the progression of the learning design approach to creating online learning experiences. During the instructional design process, it’s important to collaborate and work with the many stakeholders involved in the planning and design, especially subject matter experts.

You will explore curriculum design, collaboration and questioning techniques to create shared understandings as you develop your outline of an online course.

This course is part of the Instructional Design and Technology MicroMaster’s program from UMGC. Upon completion of the program and receipt of the verified MicroMaster’s certificate, learners may then transition into the full UMGC Master’s Program in Learning Design and Technology. See the MicroMasters program page for more information. [^1]
