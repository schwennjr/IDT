# IDT300x: Instructional Design: Digital Media, New Tools and Technology

## About this course 

Instructional designers today have a tremendous number of tools and resources available to them to create highly engaging courses. Social media, digital video, and freely available online instructional resources and applications connect and engage people in new, and exciting ways. When creating online learning experiences, instructional designers integrate and infuse these digital tools and digital content in ways that engage and connect learners to course content.

In this education and teacher training course, part of the Instructional Design and Technology MicroMasters Program, you will explore the design, development, and integration of digital media to enhance the learning experience and investigate how media, emerging and mobile tools, and online applications impact technology-mediated learning environments.

Choosing instructional materials for a course may seem like a simple step, but in fact, there are many important aspects of online learning experience development that are important to consider, such as content creation, copyright and creative commons, accessibility testing, and visual and web design techniques.

Course topics include media and visual literacy, design for online and mobile environments, use and design of open educational resources, emerging technologies, and trends in technology such as mobile learning environments.

This course is part of the Instructional Design and Technology MicroMaster’s program from UMGC. Upon completion of the program and receipt of the verified MicroMaster’s certificate, learners may then transition into the full UMGC Master’s Program in Learning Design and Technology. See the MicroMasters program page for more information. [^1]
