Conditioning is the process of developing behaviors, or responses, through repetitive exposure to external or environmental stimuli. Behavioral learning focuses on observable and quantifiable behaviors, not subjective, introspective events, such as emotion or motivation. Since behaviors are observable and quantifiable, it is easier to apply scientific experimentation to the study of this theory. Early studies in Behavioral learning began with Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov's (1849-1936) work, known as classical condition. While working on other experiments with dogs, Pavlov observed the canines salivating when the lab assistant responsible for feeding the dogs was present but without food. Pavlov theorized that the dogs associated the technician with food which triggered a natural response to being hungry. This theory led Pavlov to develop experiments that would associate a neutral stimulus, or triggers, with an environmental stimulus. The goal was to condition the dogs' natural response to food with just the neutral stimulus. The experiment associated a sound, a neutral stimulus, at the same time as the food, an environmental stimulus, was made available. The experiment then measured the saliva output to quantify the observed response. The goal of repeatedly subjecting the dogs to duel stimuli is to condition the dogs to associate the neutral trigger with the environmental trigger. After a short period, the environmental stimulus is removed, leaving only the neutral stimulus. Pavlov found that the dogs' saliva output was the same with just the neutral stimulus. Pavlov also discovered that the response to just the neutral stimulus diminished until it became extinct. While the response to the neutral stimulus eventually became extinct, the subject retained the memory proven in subsequent tests where less time was needed to relearn the behavior. Another notable collection of behaviorism experiments, which occurred in the 20th century, focused on how behaviors were affected by consequences. These experiments used an operant conditioning chamber, known as the Skinner box, created by psychologist Burrhus Frederic (B.F.) Skinner (1904-1990) (Dumper, Jenkins, Lacombe, Lovett, Perimutter. n.d.). The purpose of this box was to provide a way to observe learning processes for desired behaviors when introducing positive or negative reinforcements to the environment. One type of positive reinforcement used was dropping a food pellet into the box when the mouse pushed down a lever. Providing a positive reinforcement, in the form of a food pellet, ultimately led to the learned behavior of the subject pushing the lever whenever they were hungry. Learning Scenario The following describes how the behavioral learning theory can be used in a real world example. Home Owner Associations, a governing body of planned residential developments, are responsible for creating and enforcing bylaws. We will focus on how behaviorism is used to teach homeowners to adhere to a bylaw that is common with many HOAs, which focuses on lawn maintenance. The observable behavior in this scenario is that the homeowner's grass in their yard will not exceed 3\" in length for more than seven days. Using operant conditioning, the home owner's association board can use both reinforcements and punishments, or stimuli, to encourage the desired response. If a homeowner complies with all the bylaws are not under any probation, the board provides a positive reinforcement by giving the homeowner access to all the community's amenities. Suppose the homeowner's yard fails to comply with the HOA's standards. In that case, members of the board will begin electronic and verbal communications to the homeowner outlining future consequences if they do not correct their behavior. Once the homeowner complies, the repetitive and annoying communications will cease. This action of stopping communications would be an example of negative reinforcement. If the homeowner continues with the undesired behavior, the board will change the conditioning type from reinforcement to punishment. First, they will begin by issuing fines, a form of positive punishment. If the homeowner regularly falls back into the undesirable behavior, the association could put the homeowner on probation, resulting in the owner losing access to the community's amenities. This probation is a type of negative punishment. Strengths and Weaknesses Like all things, behaviorism has its strengths and weaknesses. First, behaviorism can be observed through responses to stimuli making it quantifiable. This observability makes it easier for the person providing the stimuli to review the response and implement other actions if it did not achieve the desired outcome. Another strength is the theory's ability to be studied through scientific methods with controlled variables and reproducible results. One of the primary weaknesses of behaviorism is that it doesn't account for other learning methods. Another weakness is that it is too deterministic. It tries to reduce learning down to stimuli and responses while ignoring the complex and emotional nuances of the human mind. Because behaviorism ignores other aspects of human behavior, this type of learning method is highly criticized as an effective learning tool for anything except \"skill and drill\" type learning.

These highly engaging and effective courses are not created by chance - they are created by instructional designers using a careful and systematic design process. In this education and teacher training course, part of the Instructional Design and Technology MicroMasters Program we will look at the history and evolution of online learning. You will explore traditional instructional design models and the progression of the learning design approach to creating online learning experiences. During the instructional design process, it\u2019s important to collaborate and work with the many stakeholders involved in the planning and design, especially subject matter experts. You will explore curriculum design, collaboration and questioning techniques to create shared understandings as you develop your outline of an online course. This course is part of the Instructional Design and Technology MicroMaster\u2019s program from UMGC. Upon completion of the program and receipt of the verified MicroMaster\u2019s certificate, learners may then transition into the full UMGC Master\u2019s Program in Learning Design and Technology.

Social media, digital video, and freely available online instructional resources and applications connect and engage people in new, and exciting ways. When creating online learning experiences, instructional designers integrate and infuse these digital tools and digital content in ways that engage and connect learners to course content. In this education and teacher training course, part of the Instructional Design and Technology MicroMasters Program, you will explore the design, development, and integration of digital media to enhance the learning experience and investigate how media, emerging and mobile tools, and online applications impact technology-mediated learning environments. Choosing instructional materials for a course may seem like a simple step, but in fact, there are many important aspects of online learning experience development that are important to consider, such as content creation, copyright and creative commons, accessibility testing, and visual and web design techniques. Course topics include media and visual literacy, design for online and mobile environments, use and design of open educational resources, emerging technologies, and trends in technology such as mobile learning environments.

Evaluation models allow instructional designers to engage in continuous improvement of course design to optimize the student learning environment. During this course we will explore evaluations models, learning management system\u2019s data analytics, and Kirkpatrick\u2019s Levels of evaluation. Finally, you will design, build and publish your capstone project, which is an online learning module.
